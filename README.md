Hello !
This is files from learning HTML & CSS full course from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&list=PLpiSUXyZN3ZqnStNQwsJHf_4AaU0BLpd-
I divided what i worked on into "Lessons" and "Exercises".
As it is self explanatory "Lessons" are files that i worked and learned during lectures from video, 
while "Exercises" are all exercises that were set to do after every lesson in the mentioned video.
